# Password-Generator

## Description
Project was built to create an application that can be used to generate a password based on the criteria selected by the user. I was provided with starter code and only needed to make additions to the JavaScript of the code. Starter code featured Password Generator app, generate button not yet functional. I learned how to break down the starter code so that I know what was needed to complete assignment. Project helped solidify concepts of prompts/alerts and if statements.


## Usage
When user loads application they will see the generator with red "Generate Password" button. When user clicks "Generate Password", they will receive prompt window asking for how many characters they would like the password to be.

Then the user will be prompted to accept/decline other criteria such as whether they would like lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Once user has gone through all prompts, the generated password will appear on the page.
